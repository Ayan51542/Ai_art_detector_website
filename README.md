Advanced AI Art & DeepFake Detector
This project is a powerful web application designed to distinguish between human-made digital art and images generated by AI. It uses a sophisticated, weighted ensemble of 7 different deep learning models combined with classic forensic image analysis techniques to provide a highly accurate and comprehensive verdict.

The application is built with Python and Flask on the backend, and features a clean, interactive web interface for easy use. For efficiency, it uses a Google Firestore database to cache the results of previously analyzed images, providing instant results for repeat queries.

Key Features
Multi-Model Ensemble: Utilizes a weighted average of 7 different state-of-the-art AI image detection models from the Hugging Face Hub for robust and nuanced analysis.

Forensic Analysis: Performs classic image forensic tests, including Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Gradient Analysis, to reveal tampering artifacts that deep learning models might miss.

Database Caching: Integrates with Google Firestore to store the results of analyzed images. This provides instantaneous results for previously seen images, saving significant time and computational resources.

Interactive Web Interface: A clean, user-friendly frontend built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript that allows for easy image uploads and clear visualization of both the deep learning and forensic results.

Ready for Deployment: The application is configured for easy deployment as a live website on platforms like Heroku.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

AI Models: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch

Image Processing: Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy

Database: Google Firestore

Deployment: Gunicorn, Heroku

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Git

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayan51542/Ai_art_detector_website.git
cd Ai_art_detector_website

2. Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Google Firestore
To enable database caching, you need to connect the application to a Google Firestore database.

Create a Firebase Project: Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Create a Firestore Database: Inside your new project, navigate to "Firestore Database" and create a new database. Start it in test mode for now.

Generate a Private Key:

In your Firebase project, go to Project settings > Service accounts.

Click "Generate new private key".

A JSON file will be downloaded. Rename this file to serviceAccountKey.json.

Place this serviceAccountKey.json file in the root directory of the project. (The .gitignore file is already configured to prevent this key from being committed to Git).

Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can start the local Flask server.

python api.py

The server will start, and it will begin the one-time process of downloading all the AI models. This may take several minutes and can use a significant amount of disk space.

Once the models are loaded, you will see a message like:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the application.

This application is configured for deployment on Heroku. For a full, step-by-step guide on how to deploy this project as a live website, please refer to the DEPLOYMENT.md file in this repository.

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new models, forensic techniques, or improvements to the code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
